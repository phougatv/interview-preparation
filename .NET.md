### What is _"managed code"_?
> Code whose execution is managed by a runtime (in this case CLR, regardless of the implementation for e.g. Mono, .NET Framework, .NET Core/.NET 5+) is called managed code.
> CLR is in charge of taking the managed code, compiling it into machine code and then executing it. On top of that, it provides important services such as automatic memory management, security boundaries, type safety etc.
